This is a small SPA project built with ReactJs that creates a to do list. The idea was to incorporate the Material UI Library as much as possible so as to focus on writing clean and organized code, instead of making a large amount of components and style them. The app itslef is very simple, there is a landing page with an empty to do list (at first) which renders the individual tasks, which can be checked when acomplished, deleted or edited. Any task that is recently created is assumed to no have been completed, while editing the tasks does not un-check them. For the editing I decided to use a MUI dialog to bring the attention of the user to what they are writing and limit the potential to forget that a task is being edited, since clicking anywhere else will colse the dialog.

Overall it is a very simple project, it uses local storage to save the information, so anyone can give it a try
